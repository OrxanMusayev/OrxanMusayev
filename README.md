## Hi, I'm Orxan Musayev 👋

Senior / Lead Software Engineer with 7+ years of hands-on experience in designing and building **scalable, high-performance, distributed systems** on **C# (.NET)**.

I specialize in **system design, domain-driven design (DDD), clean architecture, and cloud-native microservices**. My focus is on building **resilient, extensible, and production-ready platforms** rather than demo-level applications.

### 🧠 What I Do Best
- Architect and deliver **business-critical microservices**
- Design **event-driven systems** using Kafka / RabbitMQ
- Modernize **legacy monoliths → microservices**
- Apply **DDD, CQRS, Clean Architecture, SOLID**
- Build **cloud-native systems** on Azure
- Ensure **performance, reliability, security, and testability**
- Write **real tests** (Unit + Integration), not fake coverage
